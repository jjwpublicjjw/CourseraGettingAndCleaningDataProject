# Repository Overview

This repository contains code for the Course Project for the Coursera 
'Getting and Cleaning Data' course as offered during March of 2015.

## Course Project Overview

The Course Project involves transforming an existing dataset from the 
UCI Machine Learning Repository into a derived, tidy dataset. 

The orignal UCI dataset is expected to be downloaded and expanded 
into a local working directory, and the R code is to be applied 
to the expanded local dataset to produce the derived dataset. This 
repository includes the transformation logic and the derived dataset,
but does not include the original dataset.

The original dataset, the transformation, and the derived dataset are 
described in more detail in the CodeBook.md file in this repository.
